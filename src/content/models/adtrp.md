<p><em>Knockout type:</em> Whole-body KO generated using CRISPR technology.</p>
<p><em>Viability:</em> Adtrp-KO are healthy in appearance and do not exhibit developmental defects. Pups from heterozygous crosses are born at the expected Mendelian ratios.</p>
<p>In tissues with high expression of ADTRP (liver, kidney, BAT, WAT depots) several species (e.g. 9-PAHSA, 12/13-PAHSA, 9-OAHSA) of fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) and FAHFA-containing triglycerides accumulate, demonstrating that ADTRP is an endogenous FAHFA hydrolase. No differences in abundance of other lipid classes can be detected in any tissue examined. The increase in FAHFA levels in tissues of ADTRP-KO mice is not sufficient to protect mutant mice from the alterations in glucose and insulin homoestasis induced by a high-fat diet.</p>
