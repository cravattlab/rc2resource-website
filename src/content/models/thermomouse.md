<p>ThermoMouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice express luciferase under the control of the endogenous Uncoupling Protein 1 (Ucp1) promoter. Luciferase expression in these mice faithfully mimics Ucp1 expression and its response to physiologic stimuli, such as cold. ThermoMice can therefore be used to monitor Ucp1 expression in live animals in real time. They can be obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jax.org/strain/026690">JAX</a>.</p>
