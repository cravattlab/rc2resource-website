<p><em>Whole-body or conditional knockout:</em> Whole-body</p>
<p><em>Viability:</em> DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were viable; born at expected Mendelian frequency</p>
<p>DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fertile and largely exhibited normal cage behavior and general ambulation. However, aged DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (6 months) had locomotor defects, including shorter stride lengths, reductions in rearing behavior, and poorer motor coordination when compared to wildtype mice. DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not show differences in vision or willingness to explore new environments (Y-maze test), but had impaired spatial learning and memory (Barnes maze), including long-term spatial memory (re-evaluation after 2 weeks).</p>
<p>Adult (2–4 month-old) DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed accumulation of several triacylglycerol species (TAG; ~3–5 fold) in their brains, whereas other major lipid classes (e.g., phospholipids, lysophospholipids, free fatty acids,
 monoglycerols, and diacylglcerols) were unchanged. Older (10 month) mice showed similar accumulation. DDHD2<sup>+/-</sup> mice did not accumulate TAGs in their brains. TAG accumulation in DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> was age dependent: 3-week-old mice did not show accumulation of many TAGs compared to 2-month-old mice.</p>
<p>DDHD2<sup>-/-</sup> mice had an increased number, area, and diameter of lipid droplets (LD) in their brains. LD accumulation appeared to be present primarily in neurons (and not in glia) and LD were often surrounded by organelles, including mitochondria.</p>
