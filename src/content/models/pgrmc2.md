**_Knockout type:_** Conditional, adipose-specific. Strain was created by breeding mice carrying a PGRMC2 floxed allele to adiponectin-Cre mice (JAX stock 010803) to delete PGRMC2 in mature white and brown adipocytes. Mutants are in the C57BL/6J background.

**_Viability:_** Mutants are born at the expected Mendelian ratio and are indistinguishable from wildtype when examined under standard conditions.

PGRMC2 Adipose Tissue KO mice (PATKO) housed at thermoneutrality (30Â° C) are unable to activate adaptive thermogenesis when exposed to cold and perish if not rescued. Alterations in intracellular heme dynamics in brown adipocytes of PATKO mice remodel heme-sensitive transcription, giving rise to profound mitochondrial defects, the likely reason why PATKO mice cannot active thermogenesis when exposed to cold. When fed a high-fat diet (60% fat), PATKO mice show no differences in body weight or composition, except for decreased brown adipose tissue mass. However, they have higher fasting glycemia and decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. They also exhibit hyperlipidemia and exacerbated liver steatosis (70% more triglycerides).
