WWL70 is a first-generation potent and highly selective covalent inhibitor of the enzyme ABHD6, which hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. WWL70 blocked fluorophosphonate-rhodamine labeling of ABHD6 (IC50 = 70 nM) in membrane lysates from transfected HEK293T cells. Even at substantially higher concentrations (10 µM), WWL70 showed negligible cross-reactivity with other serine hydrolases in mouse brain membrane, with the exception of ABHD10 (~30% inhibition).

Prentki <em>et al.</em> have also used WWL70 in DIO mice (10 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p., daily for 8 weeks), which resulted in elevated markers of browning-related genes (e.g. Uncoupling protein 1) in visceral adipose tissue, akin to the effects observed in ABHD6 antisense oligonucleotide(ASO)-treated mice.
