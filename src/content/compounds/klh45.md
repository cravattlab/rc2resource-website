KLH45 is a potent triazole carbamate inhibitor (IC50 = 1.3 nM) of the brain triacylglyceride (TAG) hydrolase DDHD2. KLH45 is highly selective for DDHD2 over other serine hydrolases but does exhibit cross-reactivity with ABHD6, which can be controlled for by <a href="#klh40" class="js-scroll-trigger">KLH40</a>. KLH45 (20 and mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup>, 4 h) resulted in near complete inhibition of DDHD2 in vivo. Whereas acute treatment (20 mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup>, 4 h) did not result in altered brain TAGs, chronic dosing (20 mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup> every 12 h, 4 days) caused significant elevation (~1.5 fold) of TAGs in mouse brain.
