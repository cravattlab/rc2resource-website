JJH260 is a covalent inhibitor of AIG1 and ADTRP, two closely-related, atypical integral membrane hydrolases that can hydrolyze fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs). JJH260 blocked flurophosphonate rhodamine probe-labeling of AIG1 (IC50 = 0.5 µM) and ADTRP (IC50 = 8.5 µM) overexpressed individually in HEK293T cells. JJH260 had limited cross-reactivity with other serine hydrolases, which could be controlled for by using ABC34 (with the exception of LYPLA1/2). JJH260 also inhibited FAHFA hydrolysis by AIG1 in transfected HEK293T cells (IC50 = 0.6 µM) and at higher concentrations (5 µM), strongly inhibits (&gt;80%) the FAHFA hydrolase activity in AIG1-transfected HEK293T cells, LNCaP cells, and membrane fractions from human T cells.
