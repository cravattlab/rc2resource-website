CGP201725 was discovered from a screen for compounds that promoted the differentiation of 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes to adipocytes by mechanisms distinct from that of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. CGP201725 (10 µM) induced key adipogenic markers (e.g., <em>Pparg</em>, <em>Fabp4</em>, <em>Cd36</em>) in differentiating 3T3-L1s, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), 10T1/2 cells, and primary brown preadipocytes.

Comparative chemoproteomic studies in 3T3-L1s with inactive compound <a href="#cgp201726" class="js-scroll-trigger">CGP201726</a> revealed PGRMC2 as the target of CGP201725, and site-of-labeling studies indicated that it binds in the protein's cytochrome b5 heme-binding domain. Hemin (IC50 = 40 µM) and protoporphyrin IX (IC50 = 0.13 µM) competed CGP201725 (10 µM) labeling of overexpressed PGRMC2 in HEK293T cells.
