DO264 is a potent, selective, in vivo active inhibitor of ABHD12 that was developed from a high-throughput screening lead. ABHD12 is an α/β hydrolase that cleaves lyso-phosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) lipids, which are signaling molecules that modulate immune function in vivo. DO264 potently inhibited ABHD12 in mouse brain membrane proteomes (IC50 value = 6.4 nM) as determined by gel ABPP experiments against FP-Rh (1 µM, 45 min, 37 °C). DO264 also inhibited lyso-PS hydrolytic activity in lysates from mouse brain membrane (IC50 value = 2.8 nM) and human THP-1 cells (IC50 value = 6.4 nM). DO264 (0.001–1 µM, 4 h) dose-dependently increased lyso-PS and 20:4 PS levels in THP-1 cells (2 - 5x), and in primary human macrophages (1.3 - 2x increase, 1 µM, 24 h).

C57BL/6 mice treated with DO264 (i.p. / p.o.) showed dose-dependent elevations in brain lyso-PS lipids, with 30 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> being sufficient to produce the largest increases observed (2 - 5x). DO264 treated mice (30 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> i.p. daily) displayed heightened immune responses in the LCMV clone 13 (Cl13) model of immune challenge: treated animals had decreased overall survival rates (~-40% after 20 days) and lung fluid (bronchoalveolar lavage) from these mice showed increased total protein (~10x) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (~2-3x) relative to control-treated animals.

Together, DO264, its inactive control analog <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#(s)-do271">(S)-DO271</a>, and ABHD12<sup>–/–</sup> mice are powerful tools for understanding the biological function of ABHD12 and its pharmacological potential.
