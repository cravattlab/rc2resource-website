PAL-4 is a direct, reversible activator of the catalytic activity of LYPLAL1. It stimulates a concentration-dependent 2.5- and 2.3-fold increase in FP-rhodamine labeling of purified mLYPLAL1 and hLYPLAL1, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 0.39 and 0.49 μM, respectively. In synthetic substrate hydrolysis assays, PAL-4 increases the catalytic efficiency of purified mLYPLAL1, as reflected in compound-induced decreases in the Km value and increases in the Vmax value. for the enzyme. Shows selectivity over 49 other serine hydrolases quantified in MS-based ABPP-MudPIT experiments.
