CGP201721 was identified as a relatively selective competitor of the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter SLC25A20 in competitive chemoproteomic experiments with photoaffinity probe <a href="#cgp201703" class="js-scroll-trigger">CGP201703</a> in HEK293T cells. CGP201721 (20–100 µM) increased long-chain (C16, C18, C18:1) acylcarnitines (~5-20 fold) and decreased exogenous fatty acid oxidation (~60-90% inhibition) in HSC-5 cells.
