CGP201726 is an inactive compound structurally similar to <a href="#cgp201725" class="js-scroll-trigger">CGP201725</a> which did not promote adipogenesis or engage PGRMC2 (at 10 ÂµM). Because it still has photoreactive and clickable groups, it was used as a control probe in chemoproteomic studies to determine that PGRMC2 is the relevant target of <a href="#cgp201725" class="js-scroll-trigger">CGP201725</a>.
