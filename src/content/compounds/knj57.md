KNJ57 is an optimized inhibitor of the prostaglandin-metabolizing enzyme PTGR2. KNJ57 (0.5 µM, ~80%; 5 µM, 100% inhibition) selectively blocked <a href="#cgp201708" class="js-scroll-trigger">CGP201708</a> (20 µM) labeling of endogenous PTGR2 in HEK293T cells, without engaging ZADH2, another reductase enzyme that has high sequence similarity to PTGR2. KNJ57 (IC50 = 0.55 µM) inhibited recombinant PTGR2, blocking the production of 13,	14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin E2 from 15-keto prostaglandin E2. KNJ57 (0.6 – 5 µM) increased 15-keto-PGE2-dependent PPARγ transcriptional activity in PTGR2-transfected HEK293T cells.
