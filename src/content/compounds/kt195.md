KT195 is a potent covalent inhibitor of ABHD6, initially developed alongside DAGLβ inhibitors to control for their off-targets. KT195 (IC50 = 10 nM) blocked fluorophosphonate-rhodamine labeling of ABHD6 in the membrane fraction of mouse brain homogenates and showed no appreciable cross-reativity with DAGLβ (10 µM). KT195 inhibited ABHD6 in Neuro2a cells (IC50 ~ 1 nM; ~100% at 10 nM) and showed negligible activity against other serine hydrolases (25 nM). Consistent with the notion that ABHD6 acts as a 2-AG hydrolase, KT195 (25 nM, 4 h) caused an elevation of cellular 2-AG levels in Neuro2A cells but had no effect on diacylglycerols or arachidonic acid. In mice, KT195 (5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p., 4 h) completely inhibited ABHD6 in peritoneal macrophages with minimal cross-reactivity (CES3, CES2G, and PLA2G15).
