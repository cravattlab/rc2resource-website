PAL-12 is a direct, reversible activator of the catalytic activity of LYPLAL1. It stimulates a concentration-dependent 2.8- and 2.5-fold increase in FP-rhodamine labeling of purified mLYPLAL1 and hLYPLAL1, with an EC50 of 0.10  μM for mLYPLAL1. In synthetic substrate hydrolysis assays, PAL-12 increases the catalytic efficiency of purified mLYPLAL1, as reflected in compound-induced decreases in the Km value and increases in the Vmax value. Differential scanning fluorimetry thermal stability assays show that PAL-12 decreases the thermal stability of purified mLYPLAL1. In HepG2 cell lysates, PAL-12 increases LYPLAL1 activity 4-fold without affecting the activity of 55 other serine hydrolases, as assessed by MS-based ABPP-MudPIT experiments. Wild-type mice treated with PAL-12 show increased LYPLAL1 activity in liver (2-fold) and kidney (1.8-fold). Diet-induced obese mice treated with PAL-12 show improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with no adverse effects noted.
