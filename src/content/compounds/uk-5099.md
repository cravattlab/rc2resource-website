Using the YY4-yne probe, we have provided evidence that {{< scroll-link UK-5099 >}}, a long-standing and putatively covalent reversible inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), shows excellent potency (IC50~ 0.02 Î¼M) and proteomic selectivity in human cells. UK-5099 has been previously postulated to engage an (as of yet unidentified) cysteine on MPC1, but our data suggest instead that this compound may bind to C54 of MPC2.
