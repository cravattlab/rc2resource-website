UK-5099 is an alpha-cyanocinnamate inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex and was first discovered more than 30 years ago, though until recently, its precise mechanism of action and broader proteomic selecivity were poorly understood.

Using the {{< scroll-link YY4-yne >}} probe, we have provided evidence that UK-5099 shows excellent potency (IC50~ 0.02 Î¼M) and proteomic selectivity for MPC2 in human cells. UK-5099 has been previously postulated to engage an (as of yet unidentified) cysteine on MPC1, but our data suggest instead that this compound may bind to C54 of MPC2 with a reversible covalent mechanism.
