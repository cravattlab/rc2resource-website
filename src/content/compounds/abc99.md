ABC99 is a potent and selective inhibitor of NOTUM, a secreted serine hydrolase that modulates Wnt signaling. Wnt proteins are post-translationally modified (palmitoleoylation, C18:1) on a conserved serine residue by the acyltransferase porcupine (PORCN) and deacylated by NOTUM. These events control Wnt pathway output which in turn affects biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell proliferation.

ABC99 strongly inhibited NOTUM in SW620 cell conditioned media (IC50 value = 13 nM, 2 h, 37 Â°C) as determined by competitive ABPP (FP-Rh) and showed no detectable activity across 64 additional serine hydrolases quantified by MS-ABPP in SW620 cells. ABC99 also preserved Wnt signaling (IC50 value = 89 nM) in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay of Wnt activation (HEK293T-STF cells), in which conditioned media (CM) from Wnt3A-producing L-cells was mixed with CM from NOTUM-producing SW620 cells.
