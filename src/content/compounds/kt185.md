KT185 is a second-generation covalent inhibitor of ABHD6—developed specifically for this purpose—that shows increased potency and selectivity over previous inhibitors. KT185 is orally bioavailable, inhibiting ABHD6 in mouse brain (~100% inhibition at 40 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p., 4 h; &gt;70% at 20 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) with minimal cross-reactivity (other than CES1). Liver ABHD6 was completely inhibited at lower doses (~5–10 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>). KT185 inhibited ABHD6 in the membrane fraction of mouse brain homogenates (100% inhibition at 10 nM, IC50 ~ 1 nM) with no observable serine hydrolase off-targets (up to 1 µM) and in Neuro2a cells (IC50 ~ 0.25 nM).
