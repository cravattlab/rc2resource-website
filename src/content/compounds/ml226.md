ML226 is a potent inhibitor of ABHD11, with an IC50 of 15 nM and least 100-fold selectivity for ABHD11 over all other serine hydrolases in soluble proteome derived from mouse T cells (~20), as assessed by gel-based competitive ABPP with fluorophosphonate-rhodamine. ML226 is also active in cells, where it completely and selectively inhibits ABHD11 at sub-nanomolar concentrations.
