P11 is a non-covalent platelet activation factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) 1b2/1b3 inhibitor found through a fluorescence polarization-activity-based protein profiling screen of the National Institute of Health 300,000+ compound library. P11 inhibited PAFAH1b2 and PAFAH1b3 (IC50 values of ∼40 and 900 nM respectively) in a PAF substrate assay and showed no cross-reactivity with other brain serine hydrolases, including other PAFAHs such as PLA2G7 and PAFAH2. P11 (10 µM) also impaired the survival of PC3 and Neuro2a cancer cells by approximately 50%.
