WWL113 is a potent, in vivo active, covalent inhibitor of mouse Ces3 (Ces1d) and Ces1f. It inhibits Ces3 and Ces1f recombinantly expressed in HEK293T cells (IC50 ~ 0.1 &micro;M). It is also a potent inhibitor of human CES1 (IC50 = 46 nM), the homolog of mouse Ces3, in synthetic substrate hydrolysis assays. WWL113 promotes adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage in mouse 3T3-L1 and 10T1/2 preadipocytes. Treatment with WWL113 blocks basal lipolysis in mature adipocytes. In C57Bl/6 mice, a single 30 mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup> oral dose of WWL113 blocks >90% of liver and >75% of white adipose tissue Ces3 activity within 4 h. Chronic treatment of obese-diabetic <em>db</em>/<em>db</em> (30 mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup>) or Diet Induced Obese (50 mg⋅kg<sup>−1</sup>) mice resulted in weight loss, normalization of plasma glucose and lipid profiles, improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitivity, and a complete clearance of liver ectopic lipid deposits."
