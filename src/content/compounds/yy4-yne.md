YY4-yne is a covalent probe based on {{< scroll-link YY4 >}} and serves as a versatile cellular target engagement probe for MPC2 in click chemistry-enabled western blotting or global mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments.

Using YY4-yne, we demonstrated that {{< scroll-link UK-5099 >}}, an alpha-cyanocinnamate inhibitor of the MPC complex, first discovered more than 30 years ago, engages MPC2 with remarkable selectivity in human cells. These findings support a model where UK-5099 inhibits the MPC complex by binding to C54 of MPC2 in a covalent reversible manner that can be quantified in cells using the YY4-yne probe.
