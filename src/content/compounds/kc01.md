KC01 is a covalent inhibitor of AIG1 and ADTRP, two closely-related, atypical integral membrane hydrolases that can hydrolyze fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs). KC01 has a distinct reactive group (beta-lactone) from the <i>N</i>-hydroxyhydantoin carbamate <a href="#jjh260" class="js-scroll-trigger">JJH260</a>. KC01 blocked fluorophosphonate-rhodamine labeling of AIG1 (IC50 = 0.2 µM) and ADTRP (IC50 = 1.3 µM) overexpressed individually in HEK293T cells. KC01 is less selective than JJH260 (cross-reacts with ABHD16A, PAFAH2, ABHD3, etc.), which can be largely controlled for by using ABC34. KC01 (5 µM), strongly inhibits (&gt;80%) the FAHFA hydrolase activity in AIG1-transfected HEK293T cells, LNCaP cells, and membrane fractions from human T cells.
