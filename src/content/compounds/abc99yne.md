ABC99yne is a sensitive, highly-selective "click"-able probe of NOTUM, based on {{< scroll-link ABC99 >}}. ABC99yne blocked NOTUM labeling by FP-Rh (IC50 value < 1 µM;, conditioned media from SW620 cells) and strongly labeled a single protein band at \~52 kDa, when "clicked" with rhodamine-azide; no other cross-reactive proteins were observed in conditioned media or cell lysates from SW620 cells (at 0.1 μM).
