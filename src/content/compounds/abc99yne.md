ABC99yne is a sensitive, highly-selective "click"-able probe of NOTUM, based on <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#abc99">ABC99</a>. ABC99yne blocked NOTUM labeling by FP-Rh (IC50 value &lt; 1 µM;, conditioned media from SW620 cells) and strongly labeled a single protein band at ~52 kDa, when "clicked" with rhodamine-azide; no other cross-reactive proteins were observed in conditioned media or cell lysates from SW620 cells (at 0.1 μM).
